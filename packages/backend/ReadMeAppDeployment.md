what is the process to deploy to production? submitting code to appstore? or google play?

Deploying your React Native app (built with Expo) to production involves submitting it to the Apple App Store (for iOS) and Google Play Store (for Android). Since you’re using Expo with EAS (Expo Application Services), I’ll walk you through the process for both platforms, tailored to your expense-tracker-mobile project. This assumes you’ve already tested your app with development/preview builds and are ready for production deployment as of March 16, 2025.
General Prerequisites
Expo Account: Sign up at expo.dev (free tier is sufficient for basic builds).

EAS CLI: Installed globally (pnpm add -g eas-cli) and logged in (eas login).

App Configuration: Ensure app.json and eas.json are set up (from your test build steps).

Assets: Add app icons and splash screens:
./assets/icon.png (1024x1024 PNG).

./assets/splash.png (1242x2436 PNG).
Update app.json:

json

{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Expense Tracker",
    "slug": "expense-tracker-mobile",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    },
    "scheme": "yourapp",
    "extra": {
      "AUTH0_DOMAIN": "your-auth0-domain.auth0.com",
      "AUTH0_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
      "AUTH0_AUDIENCE": "https://expense-tracker-api"
    },
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.expensetracker"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.yourcompany.expensetracker"
    }
  }
}

Step 1: Configure EAS for Production
Update eas.json with a production profile:
json

{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 5.0.0"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": { "buildType": "apk" },
      "ios": { "simulator": true }
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {
      "distribution": "store",
      "autoIncrement": true
    }
  }
}

"distribution": "store": Prepares the build for app store submission.

"autoIncrement": true: Automatically increments the version number.

Step 2: Deploy to Google Play Store (Android)
Prerequisites
Google Play Developer Account: Sign up at play.google.com/console ($25 one-time fee).

Keystore: EAS manages this for you, or generate one manually if preferred.

Process
Build the Production APK/AAB:
Use an Android App Bundle (AAB) for Google Play (recommended over APK):
bash

cd expense-tracker-mobile
eas build --profile production --platform android

Select aab when prompted (EAS defaults to it for production).

EAS uploads the keystore to its servers (securely managed) unless you provide your own.

Download the Build:
After the build completes, find the .aab file in the EAS dashboard (expo.dev) under your project’s builds.

Set Up Google Play Console:
Log in to play.google.com/console.

Click Create App:
App name: "Expense Tracker".

Default language: English (or your choice).

App type: Free.

Fill out the App Details (description, privacy policy URL, etc.).

Submit the App:
Go to Production > Create New Release.

Upload the .aab file from EAS.

Complete the Content Rating, App Access, and Store Listing (screenshots, 512x512 icon).

Submit for review (takes 1-7 days, often faster for new apps).

Post-Submission:
Once approved, your app is live on Google Play. Share the URL with users.

Step 3: Deploy to Apple App Store (iOS)
Prerequisites
Apple Developer Account: Sign up at developer.apple.com ($99/year).

macOS: Required for iOS builds and App Store submission (or use a cloud service like EAS Build).

Certificates: EAS can manage these, but you’ll need to link your Apple account.

Process
Configure Apple Credentials:
Link your Apple Developer account to EAS:
bash

eas credentials

Follow prompts to set up your bundleIdentifier and certificates.

Build the Production IPA:
bash

eas build --profile production --platform ios

EAS generates an .ipa file and handles provisioning profiles and certificates.

You’ll need to authenticate with your Apple ID during the build process.

Download the Build:
Get the .ipa from the EAS dashboard.

Set Up App Store Connect:
Log in to appstoreconnect.apple.com.

Click My Apps > + > New App:
Name: "Expense Tracker".

Bundle ID: Match com.yourcompany.expensetracker from app.json.

SKU: Unique identifier (e.g., "expensetracker1").

Submit the App:
Use the Transporter app (macOS) to upload the .ipa:
Download Transporter from the Mac App Store.

Drag the .ipa into Transporter and upload.

In App Store Connect:
Go to your app > Versions > + (new version, e.g., "1.0").

Fill out App Information (description, keywords, privacy policy URL).

Add screenshots (use an iPhone simulator to capture).

Submit for review (takes 1-3 days typically).

Post-Submission:
After approval, your app is live on the App Store. Share the link with users.

Step 4: Post-Deployment Updates
For updates after initial release:
Update Version:
Increment version in app.json (e.g., "1.0.1").

Build Again:
bash

eas build --profile production --platform android
eas build --profile production --platform ios

Submit:
Upload the new .aab to Google Play Console (new release).

Upload the new .ipa to App Store Connect (new version).

Alternatively, use EAS Update for JS-only updates:
Configure updates in app.json (see test build steps).

Push updates:
bash

eas update --branch production --message "Bug fix"

Additional Tips
Privacy Policy: Generate one (e.g., via FreePrivacyPolicy.com) and host it (e.g., GitHub Pages).

Screenshots: Use Expo’s simulator (npx expo run:ios --device or npx expo run:android) to capture screens.

Testing: Test the production build locally first:
bash

eas build --profile production --platform android --local

Costs: Google Play ($25 one-time), Apple ($99/year), EAS (free tier sufficient for small apps, paid for priority builds).

Full Workflow Example
Android:
Build: eas build --profile production --platform android.

Upload .aab to Google Play Console.

Submit and wait for approval.

iOS:
Build: eas build --profile production --platform ios.

Upload .ipa via Transporter.

Submit in App Store Connect and wait for approval.

Once approved, your app is live! Let me know if you need help with specific steps, like generating assets or navigating the consoles!
